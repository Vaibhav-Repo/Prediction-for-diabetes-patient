# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various medical attributes. 
Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, we trained a machine learning model to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.

# Key Features:
1 Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, scaled features, and explored correlations.

2 Modeling: Trained and tested models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

3 Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy using metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy score, and ROC-AUC.

4 Input Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Age, etc.

5 Goal: To build a predictive system that helps in early detection of diabetes, potentially assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosis.
